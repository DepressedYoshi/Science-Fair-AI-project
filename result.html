					<h4 style="margin-top: 1em;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
					<p>Graph one is a line graph representing the rounds of training and the accuracy of the Neural network to the testing dataset with different sizes of data set. This graph shows that the quality of the performance and quantity of the training data  is proportional, and more training doesn't necessarily give the highest accuracy. If you examine table 2&3, you will see that the maximum percentage of accuracy is higher than the accuracy from final rounds of training, and it came from around twenty rounds of training. Which confirms the fact that larger training data is the key to better outcome rather than more training. On the aspect of classifying my doodling, the datatable (1) is chaotic. The percentage have a trend of going up with bigger dataset just like how neural network react to the testing dataset, but the numbers were significantly lower and fluctuate violently.the average accuracy was 61%, and again, we see that more training data definitely help increase the accuracy, but more training did not have a weighty influence on the outcome.One interesting remarks is that, I draw some chinese character for cat to use as a cat doodling during the experiment, and surprisingly, despite there are no chinese in the training data set and the character does not look like a cat, the algorithm was able to correctly classify it almost every time, and I repeated many times with different style and the result remain the same.

					<h4 style="margin-top: 2em;"><strong>So Was I Wrong?</strong></h4>
					<p>The purpose of this project is to determine if human creativity can become an advantage if AI revolts. And I hypothesize that the neural network will have a over 95% accuracy for the testing dataset but it still wonâ€™t be able to classify 50% of my doodle, this is because the algorithm  can only make a guess based on patterns, and . Numbers wise, I was wrong, the highest accuracy for testing the dataset  is 94.72% and for my doodling is 61% which means the AI failed 39% of the time. But I would say the experiment was still a success, because the numbers were off by very little amount. As for the potential cause behind the misprediction, there could be many factors. Such as the code itself.WHen i make the prediction I based my reasoning on the previous trial which I have not yet added more code to make it look better. The experiment was conducted after I made the change. Also the hardware could be a possibility, my CPU was working under high temperature. In summary, my hypothesis was wrong, the algorithms presented an outstanding performance beyond my prediction, while my hypothesis is only off by numbers, it nonetheless showed that AI is powerful, and it is only a matter of time before any data can crack any form of encryption, even with something as infinite as human creativity
